# Follows the setup of hiscore.dat for the memory range, but is
# followed by the style of encoding.  It does not try to

# gamename:
# for which game the description corresponds to
# This can be multiple games, one per line

# The score descriptions start with an @ symbol
# @:<cpu>:<address_space>:<0xaddress_start>:<0xlength>:<unused>:<unused> <format>
